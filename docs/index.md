You've reached the website for **Couleur Tweak Tips**, a comprehensive aggregation of useful resources for enthusiasts looking to expand their toolchain of programs and adopt good practices to enhance the quality of life in daily computer use and video production.

Amongst recommended programs is documentation for software and scripts I maintain, e.g. [smoothie-rs](./video/smoothie/index.md)

If you're looking for another exhaustive list of lists of awesome stuff, see [FMHY](https://fmhy.xyz) and [awesome.re](awesome.re)

This website has been meticulously curated over the years, it evolved from a [crowded discord server](https://discord.gg/ctt)
