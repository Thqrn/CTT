Links include skip tags so you dont have to bear through useless intros/sponsors

* Office chair caster wheels -  <https://youtu.be/re3zMP_UTIc>  (hairs get stuck through them over the years, making the wheels slow and unsmooth)
* Mechanical keyboard - <https://youtu.be/_M42Ri3dqoc?t=70> (I suggest emptying the bowl of keycaps right when you start drying them)
* Mousepad - <https://youtu.be/yY2uf4h01rs?t=4>
* SteelSeries' guide <https://steelseries.com/blog/how-clean-your-pc-gaming-gear-192>
