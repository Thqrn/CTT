*[SVP]: A video interpolation algorithm that is faster, but generally less accurate

*[frame blending]: A process that combines frames together to produce a motion blur effect

*[artifacts]: A noticeable distortion (such as smearing) of your video, commonly caused by interpolation

*[encoding]: The process of converting a digital video file into another compressed format.

*[encoder]: Something that converts a certain visual format (e.g. screen capture or another video file) into a compressed video format.

*[decoding]: The process of converting a compressed digital video file into a usable and viewable format.

*[decoder]: Something that converts a compressed video format into a recognizable visual format (e.g., screen display) for playback or editing purposes.

*[CBR]: Constant Bit Rate: the bitrate is the samethroughout the entire video.

*[VBR]: Variable Bit Rate: the bitrate changes throughout the video, depending on the complexity of the scene.
